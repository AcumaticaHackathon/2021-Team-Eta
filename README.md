Integration scenarios are a natural progression in Acumatica’s toolkit of low / no code configurations. 
They allow a moderately technical user to integrate Acumatica with any external system by mapping the 
external system’s required JSON structure to internal Acumatica objects, as well as define the order of 
HTTP calls that the external system expects to make or receive to transfer that data. This massively 
opens up the opportunities for Acumatica to integrate with external systems.
